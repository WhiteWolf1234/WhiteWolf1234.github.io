  <span> Legend is a great book that I have just finished reading. Legend is the first young adult book in the trilogy by Marie Lu. The second book is Prodigy and the third is Champion. The Legend trilogy takes place in the future. Legend is a amazing, suspensful book that I think you would love.  </span>
